<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
It is the policy of STUDIO SOIL to respect your privacy, and the privacy of all users of our applications. This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) has been established to help you understand our commitment to protecting your privacy, and the steps we take to ensure it. This Policy was last modified on May 26, 2019. STUDIO SOIL reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to modify the Policy.
</p>

<p>
Your privacy is very important to us and we want you to know everything we do and don’t do with the information you provide. Our guiding principle is that any information we collect from you will be treated with the utmost care and respect, and every effort will be made to ensure the information is kept private.
</p>

<p>
For purposes of the Policy, “Application” refers to "いないいないばあっ", as the case may be. Application also includes any Application updates and upgrades that STUDIO SOIL may provide to you or make available to you, or that you obtain after the date you obtain your initial copy of the Application, to the extent that such items are not accompanied by a separate Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>
Where the present Policy refers to "いないいないばあっ", it may refer to the Application or STUDIO SOIL or both, depending on the context.
</p>

<p>
BY INSTALLING, USING OR ACCESSING THE APPLICATION, YOU HEREBY ACCEPT THE POLICY WITHOUT QUALIFICATION. You have also explicitly accepted the Terms and Privacy Policy following your installation of the Application and launch of the Application for the first time.

</p>
